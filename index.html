        <p class="clear-box">My name is Dylan Feehan and I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. My passion lies
            in artificial intelligence and machine learning, so I plan to study computer science, mathematics, and
            statistics.
            One of my biggest goals is to go to graduate school for free and study machine learning.

                    <h2>My Statement of Purpose</h2>
                    <p class="clear-box">There are a few things that keep me driven on a daily basis. The first thing is that I am grateful that I was born. Some have said that the odds of 
                        being born are 1 in 400 trillion, but I think they are even more astounding than that. And to even have my finite life to experience subjective consciousness is a true miracle. 
                        But I will die, and that used to scare me. I used to be very scared about the sad reality of my inevitable death, and sometimes it still bothers me a bit. But what
                        bothers me even more is the fact that our entire species may go extint. Me dying pales in comparison to the extinction of human life. Something in me really just wants humans to stick around. I think
                        a big part of it is the potential for life and joy. If the human species were to develop technology powerful enough to expand into the cosmos, we could flourish for billions of years. Although there are 
                        many theories about the inevitable death of our universe, I would prefer at the very least that we last much longer. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I believe that it is a possibility that our species is near extinction. There are a number of current threats that could wipe us out forever, even tomorrow. At this point, I introduce superintelligence. 
                        Superintelligent AGI is something that I find incredibly fascinating. It is somewhat of a fantasy, but it's existence is possible according to the laws of physics. I believe that if we as a species
                        can develop superintelligent AGI, the liklihood of existing for billions of years and filling our universe with life increases greatly. It is for this reason that I am interested in artificial intelligence. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To wrap it up, I admmit that even if superintelligent AGI can be developed, it will probably never exist in my lifetime. This means that I want to focus on the more immediate problems that artificial intelligence can solve. This way, AI can buy our species enough time to develop AGI and populate the universe with life!</p>
